## Exercise 1.1 – Hello, world!
Recall that a program is just a set of instructions for the computer to execute. Let’s start with a basic command:

print(x): Prints the value of the expression x, followed by a new line.

Create a new program called hello_world.py. You will use this file to write your very first ‘Hello, world!’ program.


1. Inside the directory assignments/01_1_lesson, create a new file and name it hello_world.py

2. Edit the file and add the following line:

  print("Hello, World!")

3. Save the file

4. Open a new terminal that is NOT an interactive python interpreter, and type:
  python3 hello_world.py

Congratulations!  You have written your first program in Python.
