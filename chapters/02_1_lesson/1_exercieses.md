Exercise 1  
Repeating my advice from the previous chapter, whenever you learn a new feature, you should try it out in interactive mode and make errors on purpose to see what goes wrong.

1.1 - We’ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?

1.4 - What if you put a period at the end of a statement?


1.5 - In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: x y. What happens if you try that in Python?



Exercise 2  
Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator:

2.2 - Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
